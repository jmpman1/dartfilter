## Introduction

***DartFilter*** is a Windows Kernel File System Minifilter driver that stops Ransomware activity through a Honeypot detection method, monitoring it's files.

> NOTE: The driver was tested on Windows 10 Education Build 19041 and it's likely to work on new and recent Windows 10 versions.

## How it Works

* ***DartFilter*** intercept every _PreCreateFile_, _PreWriteFile_ and _PreSetFileInformation_ operation on the Honeypot
* Whenever a ransomware or any process tries to perform one of the operations mentioned in our Honeypot, the process gets terminated and returns with an access denied status

## Installation

Here are the installation steps required to load the driver in your system:

### Configure Test Mode

Open PowerShell/Cmd in Administrator mode and run the following command to allow Windows to self-sign Kernel drivers:

```
Bcdedit.exe -set TESTSIGNING ON
```

After running the command, restart the computer and you'll be in Test Mode.

> NOTE: If you wish to turn the Test Mode off, execute the same command with the OFF argument (Bcdedit.exe -set TESTSIGNING OFF)

### Installing DartFilter as a Service

In the "bin" folder on the repository, right-click on the _DartFilter.inf_ file and select the "Install" option.

### Start DartFilter

Now, after installing ***DartFilter***, we must start the service. Opening the PowerShell/Cmd in Administrator mode, run the following command to start or stop the service:

```
sc start DartFilter
```

```
sc stop DartFilter
```

## Usage

To create the Honeypot, make sure to add decoy files in a folder that contains *"_dart"* added to it's name. If you'd like to, feel free to download the Honeypot folder in this repository.
